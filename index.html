    <h1>Bio</h1>
    <p>Hi, I’m Harman Bhogal, a second-year Computer Science student at Simon Fraser University (SFU). My passion for coding and problem-solving has been a key part of my academic journey. While I’m skilled in various programming languages, C++ is my preferred method of solving any problem. 

      Alongside my studies, I work as a math tutor for younger children. Teaching has been an incredibly rewarding experience, and allows me to gain a deeper understanding of my local community. 
      
      My goal is to eventually become a software engineer, and I’m eager to continue developing my coding abilities and gaining real-world experience. I’m particularly interested in the developing area of Artificial intelligence. 
      
      Outside of school and tutoring, I enjoy going to the gym. I also love playing video games and watching movies. </p>
