    <h1>Bio</h1>
    <img src="imgs/View recent photos.jpeg">
    <p>Hi, I’m Harman Bhogal, a second-year Computer Science student at Simon Fraser University (SFU). My passion for coding and problem-solving has been a key part of my academic journey. While I’m skilled in various programming languages, C++ is my preferred method of solving any problem. </p>

     <p> Alongside my studies, I work as a math tutor for younger children. Teaching has been an incredibly rewarding experience, and allows me to gain a deeper understanding of my local community. </p>
      
     <p> My goal is to eventually become a software engineer, and I’m eager to continue developing my coding abilities and gaining real-world experience. I’m particularly interested in the developing area of Artificial intelligence. </p>
      
    <p>  Outside of school and tutoring, I enjoy going to the gym. I also love playing video games and watching movies. </p>
