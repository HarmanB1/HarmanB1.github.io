            <h1>Bio</h1>
            
            <p>Hi, I’m Harman Bhogal, a second-year Computer Science student at Simon Fraser University (SFU). My passion for coding and problem-solving has been a key part of my academic journey. While I’m skilled in various programming languages, C++ is my preferred method of solving problems. </p>

            <p> Alongside my studies, I work as a math tutor for younger children. Teaching has been an incredibly rewarding experience and allows me to gain a deeper understanding of my local community. </p>
            
            <p> My goal is to eventually become a software engineer, and I’m eager to continue developing my coding abilities and gaining real-world experience. I’m particularly interested in the developing field of Artificial Intelligence. </p>
            
            <p> Outside of school and tutoring, I enjoy going to the gym. I also love playing video games and watching movies. </p>
            
            
            <h2>What I'm Currently Working On</h2>
            <p>
            I am currently learning Java for mobile app development, C# for Windows applications, and experimenting with OpenCV, TensorFlow, and MediaPipe
            for AI and camera tracking experimentation. 
            </p>
            <p>
            Goal: After learning these applications, specifically the Python libraries, my eventual goal is to build an application that unlocks a device—specifically a Windows laptop—through user gestures.
            </p>
